# Simple-Raspberry-Pi-Clock

This basic bit of python displays the time and date in the console, but with the addition of a Adafruit 16x2 Character LCD it can display time time and date on a screen and transform the Raspberry Pi into a digital clock, this code is very short and it can be easily modified to add features such as a timer and an alarm.

Hope you enjoy
